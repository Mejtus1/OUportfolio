HTML5 Learning #3 embedded audio

<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>Well, I'm becoming a fan of HTML5. Audio is straightforward too, either with a <i>local file</i> such as this MP3 file, A Better Way, that I uploaded to Open Sites from the TM111 Media Database:</p>
<p></p><audio controls="controls">
<source src="a-better-way.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
<p> or an <i>external link</i>, such as this one from the Lisztonian website which provides free classical piano music from popular composers:</p>
<p>
<audio controls>
<source src="http://lisztonian.com/music/download/Invention+No+1+in+C+Major-109.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
